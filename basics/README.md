# Basics

In this file you will be able to see the scripts in order to apply simple commands on shell. These scripts will give you the opportunity to activate directly these commands without any error, and will make you able to understand how to create a script and also how to give a file the authority to execute the command given to.

In this file you will see as below:
- [0-current_working_directory](https://github.com/eno007/shell/blob/main/basics/0-current_working_directory) 
**(Script that contains the command `pwd` and will identify at which path you are working.)** 
- [1-listit](https://github.com/eno007/shell/blob/main/basics/1-listit) 
**(Script that will list files. `ls` on its own lists all files in the current directory except for hidden files. )**
- [2-bring_me_home](https://github.com/eno007/shell/blob/main/basics/2-bring_me_home) 
**(Script that contains command `cd` and in Linux it offers several ways to navigate and change the working directory using the terminal window. It lets you change directories using relative and absolute paths, move to parent or root directories, or find directories with incomplete names.)** 
  - *(**The `cd` command is a built-in shell command. This means that its behavior varies slightly between shells since it uses shell environment variables.**)* 
- [3-listfiles](https://github.com/eno007/shell/blob/main/basics/3-listfiles) 
**Script that contains command `ls -l` and it is used to list :** 
  1. *contents of the directory in a table* 
  2. *format with columns including content permissions*, 
  3. *number of links to the content*, 
  4. *owner of the content*,
  5. *group owner of the content*,
  6. *size of the content in bytes*,
  7. *last modified date / time of the content*,
  8. *file or directory name*.
- [4-listmorefiles](https://github.com/eno007/shell/blob/main/basics/4-listmorefiles) 
**Script that contains command `ls -l -a`  or you can type `ls -a -l` or `ls -la` or `ls -al` to list files or directories in a table format with extra information including hidden files or directories:** 
- [5-listfilesdigitonly](https://github.com/eno007/shell/blob/main/basics/5-listfilesdigitonly) 
**Script that contains command `ls -l -a -n`  or you can type `ls -lan` to list long format with user and group IDs, displayed numerically including hidden files (starting with .)** 
- [6-firstdirectory](https://github.com/eno007/shell/blob/main/basics/6-firstdirectory) 
**Script that contains command `mkdir path/name of the new directory`  to create a directory in the required path with the required title.**
