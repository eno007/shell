# Shell

The shell is the Linux command line interpreter. It provides an interface between the user and the kernel and executes programs called commands. For example, if a user enters ls then the shell executes the ls command. The shell can also execute other programs such as applications, scripts, and user programs (e.g., written in c or the shell programming language).

In this file you will see a variety of commands executable for different tasks as you can find below:

- **[Permissions](https://github.com/eno007/shell/tree/main/permissions)**
- **[I/O redirections and filters](https://github.com/eno007/shell/tree/main/io_redirections_and_filters)**
- **[Init files, variables and expansions](https://github.com/eno007/shell/tree/main/init_files_variables_and_expansions)**
- **[Loops, Conditions and Parsing](https://github.com/eno007/shell/tree/main/loops_conditions_and_parsing)**
- **[Processes and Signals](https://github.com/eno007/shell/tree/main/processes_and_signals)**

There have been a numerous challenges but i am giving to you just a glimpse of what you can do with some simple codes and how you can use them in order to make what your imagination brings you to. Take a breath and get into this. Have fun!
