# Init files variables and expansions
In this project you will be able to see a variety of scripts that are going to be used in order to print requested tasks related to **variables** and **expansions**.
You will see scripts that are going to give you a better insight of:
## Variables
1. What is the difference between a local and a global variable
2. What is a reserved variable
3. How to create, update and delete shell variables
4. What are the roles of the following reserved variables: HOME, PATH, PS1
5. What are special parameters
6. What is the special parameter $??

## Expansions
1. What is expansion and how to use them
2. What is the difference between single and double quotes and how to use them properly
3. How to do command substitution with $() and backticks

## The `alias` Command
1. How to create an alias
2. How to list aliases
3. How to temporarily disable an alias
